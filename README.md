description i made to a non-Gamer, also origin of the tongue-in-cheek title:
so imagine. you have a RPG character, with stats and a class that gives them special abilities that other classes don't have. basic RPG things. so the basic gameplay loop is: you take your character, you give them some weapons from your Personal Stash, and you go out to play a round of Boomer Extraction Hero Shooter 4: Ponytails of the Balding. in the round, your goal is to collect Loot and kill Enemies (which are often sources of More Loot, and come in both npc and Real Person flavors), without dying. If you die, all the stuff you brought with you from your personal stash is lost, but if you don't die and instead you find a spot to Leave The Round and you successfully Leave The Round, all the loot you picked up is taken to your personal stash to sell for Money or bring with you for future rounds, and you also get XP that you can spend to level up your stats and your abilities. stats might be things like base health, or being better with a particular type of weapon, or a stronger piss laser or whatever you have for a class ability. money can then be exchanged for gear from some sort of vendor, or attachments for your gear, or whatever. honestly im picturing like. geigeresque science fantasy, where your class options are like witch and barbarian but the barbarian Does have a laser shotgun


unsure if i want some sorta like. kit rental system, or if you wanna go out naked you can just choose to go out naked and fight with your bare hands. if it's a rental, i think i want Consequences for Renting; there is a (very minor) Monetary Cost to using the rental service that you Can go into debt for, plus any gear from the rental kit that you don't bring back is credited as more debt to pay off. so if you're renting, yes there's a significant payday to punching up, but unless you're looting actual cash, you're gonna have to sell some of the fancy new loot you got. (the deposit on rented gear is probably waived if you rent and then die so you dont get players stuck in a constant debt cycle)
