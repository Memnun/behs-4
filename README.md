description i made to a non-Gamer, also origin of the tongue-in-cheek title:

so imagine. you have a RPG character, with stats and a class that gives them special abilities that other classes don't have. basic RPG things. so the basic gameplay loop is: you take your character, you give them some weapons from your Personal Stash, and you go out to play a round of Boomer Extraction Hero Shooter 4: Ponytails of the Balding. in the round, your goal is to collect Loot and kill Enemies (which are often sources of More Loot, and come in both npc and Real Person flavors), without dying. If you die, all the stuff you brought with you from your personal stash is lost, but if you don't die and instead you find a spot to Leave The Round and you successfully Leave The Round, all the loot you picked up is taken to your personal stash to sell for Money or bring with you for future rounds, and you also get XP that you can spend to level up your stats and your abilities. stats might be things like base health, or being better with a particular type of weapon, or a stronger piss laser or whatever you have for a class ability. money can then be exchanged for gear from some sort of vendor, or attachments for your gear, or whatever. honestly im picturing like. geigeresque science fantasy, where your class options are like witch and barbarian but the barbarian Does have a laser shotgun


~~unsure if i want some sorta like. kit rental system, or if you wanna go out naked you can just choose to go out naked and fight with your bare hands. if it's a rental, i think i want Consequences for Renting; there is a (very minor) Monetary Cost to using the rental service that you Can go into debt for, plus any gear from the rental kit that you don't bring back is credited as more debt to pay off. so if you're renting, yes there's a significant payday to punching up, but unless you're looting actual cash, you're gonna have to sell some of the fancy new loot you got. (the deposit on rented gear is probably waived if you rent and then die so you dont get players stuck in a constant debt cycle)

loot is in the form of weapon mods that give stat buffs or class-specific ability buffs, on top of their weapon-specific utility (optics, brakes, grips, stocks, etc.), as well as consumables like potions and grenades. loot can be sold in town (or or broken down by the sapper) for Magical Components and Mechanical Components. Components can be used by the Witch to craft consumables, or they can be traded in town for consumables, buffs, etc. basically COMPONENTS ARE CASH HERE

the vibes im imagining could best be described as "geigeresque cyberpunk". weapons are largely lasers and sci-fi, but perhaps sometimes there's organic components to make your gun work. yea there'll be a forest map bc extraction shooters need a forest map, but there will be an unexplained Humming Monolith in the middle of the map that has an opening in the side and if you go inside you insta die. there will be neon. there will be meat. there will be nature desperately fighting back against the corrupting influences of the neon and the meat. like if Doom (2016) took place in the appalachian mountains instead of mars, and the gateway to hell was a 90s roller rink. (actually dang a 90s roller rink in the middle of the woods would be a fantastic map)

SHADOWRUN FLAVORED SETTING. CHICAGO, BUG CITY. 


mh style story progression; key quests taken in any order unlock urgent quest, which grants rank up (better shop items, harder key quests for the next rank up). urgent quests are pure pvp objectives, death match style; forced mutually exclusive objectives alongside other people also attempting the urgent (eg, two squads are dropped in and both told "extract with the maguffin", holding the maguffin broadcasts your location on radar so other groups are hunting you down, fail condition of the maguffin leaving the zone via extract causes the failing players to die and lose their shit. "I'll just run it naked so I'm not losing anything" your time on this earth is being wasted, you would be DONE by now if you just brought a kit. it's fine it'll be fine)
quests are all just objectives you have to complete in the zone before you're Authorized to extract
"loot this" "kill this" "destroy this" kinda shits
